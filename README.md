# -A-deep-learning-mechanism-for-responsive-bot-detection-in-social-networking-sites
Abstract </br> </br>
This research introduces bot detection algorithms for spotting automated accounts on Twitter and quantifying their impact on the current state of the web. The use of bots on social media is widespread. Accounts created by automated programs are a major security risk because they can propagate false information and boost sales of questionable products or undermine the credibility of political campaigns. Since most bots will go to great lengths to hide their existence, spotting their activities can be a difficult task. We introduce a novel machine learning algorithm that considers a number of features for bot detection, such as the length of usernames, the frequency with which they repost, temporal patterns, sentiment expression, the ratio of followers to friends, and the variability of their messages
